Threshold.mlx, Threshold_proportional.mlx : Files for Threshold Matrix Data
cluster_identification_Qd: gives you layer_node_per_cluster cell data, and prob_of_node_per_cluster cell data. 
Visually can see cluster labels compared per layer. And the nodes per layer in each common cluster.
plot_EGG_cluster: plots the probability of the node being in the cluster, the bigger the weight of the node the bigger ~= higher probability node in cluster

Issues:
ploot_EGG labels given were causing issues , using default
using the EGG to plot all layer is too time consuming therefore better to use topoplots for all layers.
EGG plot's are good for probability node identification per common community cluster
